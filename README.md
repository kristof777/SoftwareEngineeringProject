# SoftwareEngineeringProject

This project was done as a colaberative effort by a team of 14 people.
The backend was written in Python, the front end, in HTML/CSS, Typescript and Javascript. The project made use of Django, Ionic framework, GoogleAppEngine/webbapp2, and Jenkins. 
The backend API scripts are stored in server-gae/, while the frontend code is in src/

For an example of code written by me, check out the server-gae/web_apis/Change_Password.py script.
