# SoftwareEngineeringProject

This project was done as a collaborative effort by a team of 14 people. The back-end was written in Python, the front end, in HTML/CSS, Typescript and Javascript. The project made use of Django, Ionic framework, GoogleAppEngine/webbapp2, and Jenkins. The back-end API scripts are stored in server-gae/, while the front-end code is in src/.

For an example of code written by me, check out the server-gae/web_apis/Change_Password.py script.
